This is a relatively new area of pacing that is continuing to gain popularity among pacing specialists as being more physiological than the traditional form of right ventricular pacing (RVP), as well as emerging as an alterna\u00ad tive to biventricular cardiac resynchronization therapy (BiV-CRT) in cases of heart failure (HF) with conduction system disease. When the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on pacing1 were being formulated, CSP had already been investigated for several years, mainly in the form of HBP in cases of atrioventricular (AV) block, for pacing in the setting of AV nodal ablation and as a sub\u00ad stitute for BiV-CRT in selected patients. At that point, most of the in\u00ad formation on HBP was observational with short-term follow-up, and there were only two small randomized controlled pilot trials that in\u00ad cluded more than one centre.2\u20135 A conservative approach towards HBP was therefore taken, and no recommendations regarding LBBAP were formulated due to limited available data at that time. Ever since the publication of the 2021 guidelines, the use of CSP has greatly evolved, mainly with LBBAP,6 due to perceived greater ease of implantation and superior electrical parameters compared with HBP.

Recent European surveys7,8 and the recent MELOS registry9 are examples of the extensive use of CSP. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) published a consensus document on CSP implant\u00ad ation to standardize the technique.10 The 2024 updated EHRA core curriculum now includes CSP in its syllabus.11 This emphasizes the im\u00ad portance of proper training and patient selection for CSP. Recently, the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) guidelines on physiologic\u00ad al pacing have expanded the indications for CSP.12 Given the increasing published evidence and consensus among European experts on the likely benefits of CSP and to reconcile the European recommendations on pacing and cardiac resynchronization with current practice, we decided to update advice on indications for CSP.

This process begins at the molecular level and extends to macroscopic changes, such as asynchronous hypertrophy, leading to a progressive decline in left ventricular (LV) function (Figure 1). This decline is associated with in\u00ad creased episodes of HF and, consequently, higher mortality.15 Evidence suggests that pacing at any myocardial site within the right ventricle (RV), not just the apex, is associated with detrimental haemo\u00ad dynamic effects.16 The slow electrical propagation through the myocar\u00ad dium can lead to ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony,17 LV dysfunction, and HF, particularly in patients who require a high percent\u00ad age of pacing.18 Among the first studies to report detrimental outcome associated with RVP, in both patients with and without pre-existing HF, were the DAVID and MOST trials.18\u201320 The clinical entity of pacing-induced car\u00ad diomyopathy (PICM) was introduced over the following years, which af\u00ad fects 10\u201320% of patients who receive RVP.21,22 It is difficult to ascertain which patients will develop PICM, despite some predictors having been described [e.g. paced QRS duration (QRSd)23]. In addition, there is no evidence of clinical benefit of alternative pacing sites such as RV septal pa\u00ad cing over RV apical pacing.24 For these reasons, pacing strategies such as BiVP or CSP have been developed to avoid or to attenuate PICM.

Most probably, this makes little difference in patients without documented structural heart disease,36 but some observational studies have reported worse outcomes for patients with HF with LVSP compared with LBBP.39,40 Another open question is whether LBBP is superior to LFP, as suggested by a small ob\u00ad servational study in patients with HF.41 His bundle pacing vs. left bundle branch area pacing Conduction system pacing utilizing HBP and LBBAP has been utilized for the management of both bradycardia and HF indications.

Conduction system pacing in atrioventricular node ablation In patients with rapidly conducted and symptomatic atrial tachyarrhyth\u00ad mias refractory to medical or ablative therapy, AVNA is an established therapeutic strategy. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the combined effects of loss of AV synchrony, beat-to-beat irregularity, and rapid ven\u00ad tricular rates can lead to a reduction in cardiac output with adverse car\u00ad diac remodelling, and HF symptoms. These patients may benefit from a \u2018pace-and-ablate\u2019 strategy (Figure 6).140\u2013143 In a recent network meta-analysis comparing AF therapies including pharmacological treat\u00ad ment and different AF ablation modalities (radiofrequency, cryoballoon, and surgical ablation), the \u2018pace-and-ablate\u2019 strategy showed a consistent trend compared with other treatments in reducing cardiovascular and all- cause mortality, re-hospitalization, and stroke.144 The combination of AVNA and conventional RVP has shown to be effective in controlling heart rate and regularizing ventricular response.

A sig\u00ad nificant absolute mortality reduction of 18% was obtained with AVNA + BiVP at 4-year follow-up [11% mortality in the AVNA + BiVP group vs. 29% in the pharmacological rate control group (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10\u20130.65)]. The different available pacing modalities for combination with AVNA are outlined in Table 3.

However, death or hospitalization due to HF occurred in 30% of patients at 1-year follow-up.139 Another non-randomized, prospective, multicentre, case\u2013control study evaluated the feasibility, clinical efficacy, and outcomes of upgrad\u00ad ing to LBBAP in 48 BiV-CRT non-responders. The results indicated that upgrading to LBBAP is both feasible and effective, with significant clinical improvements being observed.220 This makes LBBAP a potential pacing strategy, albeit with limited evidence at this point, for patients who do not respond to traditional BiV-CRT and remain with wide QRS despite it.

Delayed activation of the LV lateral wall in patients with HF may result not only from a discrete lesion in the left bundle branch that can be bypassed/corrected by CSP, but also from widespread delay, distal focal lesion(s) in the conduction system, electrical uncoupling, myocardial scar, and functional conduction block. In patients with wider QRS, non-typical LBBB and more advanced HF, both mechanisms (focal proximal lesion and distal delay) often coexist. Analysis of V6RWPT\u2014an electrocardiographic marker of LV lateral wall activation time, indicates that such conduction delay cannot be cor\u00ad rected by CSP alone.223 In patients with narrow QRS complexes or iso\u00ad lated RBBB, the V6RWPT during LBBP closely follows the intrinsic native activation times and remains within the norm for the V6 intrinsic deflection time (i.e. 50\u201360 ms). This value plus the left bundle branch latency of 20\u201330 ms yields physiologically paced V6RWPT values of 70\u201390 ms.

However, in patients with wide baseline QRS complexes due to LBBB or NIVCD, V6RWPT values during confirmed left bundle branch capture are often non-physiological (>90 ms), suggesting that despite proximal LBB capture, additional LV conduction delay remained and coronary sinus pacing may be required to correct this.223 Furthermore, in a significant percentage of patients in whom LBBP is attempted, only LVSP is achieved,9 resulting in a potentially important additional delay in LV lateral wall activation. On the contrary, conventional BiV-CRT is also limited in its ability to fully restore physiological LV activation. This is due to several factors: potentially desynchronizing effects of myocardial pacing with the RV lead, localized non-physiological epicardial LV pacing, latency, and sub\u00ad optimal LV lead position (paraseptal/apical) due to unfavourable cardiac venous anatomy and/or LV scar. Failure of BiV-CRT to restore physio\u00ad logic activation may manifest as QRS prolongation rather than narrow\u00ad ing. This is observed in one-third of BiV-CRT patients and is associated with a poor prognosis compared with patients with narrowing of QRS after BiV-CRT.224 The combination of CSP and coronary sinus pacing/RVP (Figure 9) may address some of the limitations of both techniques, providing more physiological LV activation and thus a narrower QRS and a more efficient form of CRT.

When both these conditions were met, the benefit of LOT-CRT was most pronounced, with a 14.5% greater im\u00ad provement in LV dP/dtmax and a 20.8 ms shorter QRS duration than during LBBAP.213 The selection of LOT-CRT over HOT-CRT or vice versa is currently based on the operator\u2019s preference, experience, and ability to imple\u00ad ment HBP and LBBP, as well as on case-dependent anatomical and physiological factors that influence the feasibility of HBP and LBBAP. It is important to note, however, that LOT-CRT usually offers superior pacing parameters and normal sensing without compromising arrhyth\u00ad mia detection in cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems, while HOT-CRT may provide superior QRS nar\u00ad rowing due to the direct recruitment of the right bundle branch in the setting of LBBB. Patients with permanent AF cannot benefit from algorithms which adjust AV delays to promote fusion between intrinsic conduction and ventricular pacing, used in BiV-CRT.228 In these patients, HOT-CRT with HBP (usually using the off-label configuration of connecting the lead to the unused atrial channel of the generator) combined with cor\u00ad onary sinus and/or RV pacing may be used to deliver controlled and constant fusion pacing by adjusting AV delay, even in patients in whom bundle branch block remains uncorrected by HBP.99,225 Although there are no dedicated randomized studies on HOT/ LOT-CRT, it is pertinent to note that, unlike CSP-CRT, these pacing modalities do not deviate too much from", "paper_id": "euaf050", "section": ""}

Nevertheless, operator experience and patient risk need to be carefully taken into account, particularly when evaluating upgrade procedures.

Several small observational studies have already shown this with a sig\u00ad nificant LVEF increase in patients undergoing CSP, as well as reductions in LV end-systolic volume, improvement in functional capacity, and QRS duration, with similar improvements observed with both HBP and LBBAP.129,230,233\u2013239 These observational studies show scope for im\u00ad provement in those patients with mild\u2013moderate LV impairment as well as those with severe LV dysfunction (see Supplementary material online, Table S7). In a meta-analysis of eight observational stud\u00ad ies including 217 patients (mean baseline LVEF 38.4%\u00b1 8.8), LVEF, NYHA, and QoL were significantly improved by upgrade to CSP.230 Predictors of PICM or HF development after RVP include a lower baseline LVEF, a larger LV end-diastolic diameter, a longer paced QRS duration, and a higher RVP percentage.233 Importantly, although upgrading to CSP may improve echocardiographic parameters in pa\u00ad tients with PICM, the mechanism of improvement is unclear and the mechanistic contribution of factors including change in activation pat\u00ad tern (broad QRS to narrower QRS) and reverse remodelling is un\u00ad known. That said, in observational studies with up to 12-month follow-up, the improvements in LVEF and LV end-diastolic dimension do not appear to return to the levels seen in individual patients prior to RVP.128,129,234 Thus, identifying patients at a higher risk of developing PICM prior to initial device implant may be important when selecting between RVP and CSP, as CSP has been seen to be associated with a lower risk of adverse outcomes associated with PICM and subsequent HF-related hospitalization.26,107 Device upgrade to BiV-CRT may be considered in patients with PICM", "paper_id": "euaf050", "section": ""}

Although the benefits of upgrading may exceed the risks, interventions aimed at re\u00ad ducing these risks must be undertaken.240 Clinicians need to have an appropriate care pathway in place to en\u00ad able the screening of CIED patients to identify patients who might benefit from a device upgrade. Pacing burden and patient symptom as\u00ad sessment are likely to form the cornerstone of this evaluation and be complemented by measurement of BNP levels and echocardiographic assessment where indicated.

The PROTECT UP clinical trial (NCT06052475) is currently recruiting and aims to as\u00ad sess the benefit of device upgrade on QoL in 155 patients with mild-to-moderate LV impairment only. Depending on the existing device, several strategies can be used dur\u00ad ing device upgrade, including use of the same device (abandoning the existing ventricular lead), implanting a new generator with an additional port to connect the CSP lead and avoid abandoning the existing ven\u00ad tricular lead or performing HOT/LOT-CRT (see Supplementary material online, Figures S1\u2013S3). Currently, most transvenous defibrillators use the DF-4 standard, in which both the high- and low-voltage (i.e. pacing) connections are in a single pin, thus reducing the need for bulky device headers and facilitat\u00ad ing connection during implant. Although this advantage has led to wide\u00ad spread adoption of this type of connection, patients in whom device downgrade is required (i.e. from a defibrillator to a pacemaker) will re\u00ad quire either the utilization of a DF-4 ICD with deactivation of the high energy capabilities or insertion of an additional IS-1 lead to facilitate the use of a standard pacemaker.241 Moreover, patients who have a defib\u00ad rillator implanted may, during their lifetime, require upgrading to a de\u00ad vice capable of CRT. In this scenario, the use of a DF-1 device may facilitate LBBAP and even avoid having to change the generator if the residual longevity is considered to be adequate (see Supplementary material online, Figure S2", "paper_id": "euaf050", "section": ""}

In this scenario, the use of a DF-1 device may facilitate LBBAP and even avoid having to change the generator if the residual longevity is considered to be adequate (see Supplementary material online, Figure S2 and Table S8). When using a DF-1 device, the CSP lead (usually LBBAP, as HBP provides suboptimal sensing para\u00ad meters) is connected to the IS-1 port in the defibrillator block, and the IS-1 connector pin from the DF-1 lead is capped and abandoned. Thus, CRT can be achieved with a less expensive device and without the need for a new generator.242 As sensing parameters are favourable in the left bundle branch area, it is anticipated that arrhythmia detection using a LBBAP lead will be similar to that of a lead located in the RV apex. A small study showed no significant differences in the detection duration of an induced ventricular fibrillation episode between left bundle branch area and RV lead locations.243 Alternative approaches here in\u00ad clude utilization of a new generator with a DF-4 connector and IS-1 connector for the upgraded lead. This has the advantage of no aban\u00ad doned lead component. A concept that is emerging is the use of ICD leads for delivering CSP.244,245 However, the long-term safety and efficacy of this approach needs to be evaluated. ..................................................................

An important aspect of patient\u2019s education should take place follow\u00ad ing CSP implantation. This is especially relevant in an emergency setting, in particular, when the patient is in a medical centre that is not familiar with new CSP technologies.

Although CSP is gaining increasing adoption, many aspects of CSP implantation are likely to be improved in the near future. The pacing leads currently used for CSP were initially designed for conventional endocardial pacing sites, and concerns remain regarding their long- term performance.10 In particular with LBBAP, the lead is screwed deeply into the septum, creating novel forms of mechanical stress on these leads. Despite several pacing leads being approved for CSP by regulatory boards, data on the impact of these new use conditions on long-term lead performance are scarce. Early conductor fractures, especially with LBBAP, have been reported in case studies or as single- centre experiences.247\u2013251 The recent LIFE-LBBAP study,252 a large international multicentre registry, showed a lead survival probability of 99.7% at mid-term follow-up, with lead fracture rates varying be\u00ad tween 0.04 and 0.4%, depending on the lead design. Some of these early conductor fractures with LBBAP have been attributed to implant-related conditions, such as kinking of the lead during septal deployment or excessive angulation within the septum, while others might result from fatigue due to repeated bending over time.248,251 Identifying these mechanisms can guide future developments in CSP-specific lead designs.

Remote monitoring of CIEDs offers several advantages over traditional in-office visits, including the early detection of lead failures, device malfunctions, and significant arrhythmias through automated alerts. For patients with CIEDs, remote monitoring is part of standard of care.1,256 More data are needed on the usability of remote monitoring specifically in CSP. Data on the safety of extracting CSP leads are limited, and data on extraction of CSP leads with long lead dwell times are needed. In the recent international TECSPAM study, the success and safety of extract\u00ad ing HBP and LBBAP leads were high, although the average lead dwell time was only 2 years. Retained distal fragments might pose a risk during the extraction of fractured lead segments, indicating the need for ex\u00ad pertise with femoral extraction tools in CSP lead extraction.257 Additionally, specific extraction tools may be needed in the future to extract CSP leads with longer dwell times. There are scant data regarding CSP in populations such as children, patients with complex congenital heart disease, or specific conditions such as genetic conditions or sarcoidosis.
