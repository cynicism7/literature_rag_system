The study findings reveal that economic growth and energy structure play a significant role in driving AI adoption, while inadequacies in infrastructure and limited financial inclusion significantly hinder AI progress. Additionally, the analysis reveals a positive relationship between AI adoption and CO2 emissions, where early stages of technology uptake lead to increased emissions, but sustained integration eventually results in efficiency gains that help to reduce them. These findings underscore the need for E-7 nations to adopt targeted policies that modernize digital and physical infrastructure, broaden financial access, and expedite the transition to sustainable energy systems.

Introduction The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming multiple sectors worldwide, altering the fabric of energy systems, infrastructure development, financial markets, and innovation capabilities [1\u20133]. Emerging economies, especially those in the E-7 group such as China, India, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and Turkey, face complex challenges and opportunities as they integrate AI into their development strategies [4]. AI- driven technologies offer considerable potential to optimize renewable energy management, improve infrastructure efficiency, expand access to digital finance, and accelerate GDP growth through innovation. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by growing con- cerns over energy consumption, carbon emissions, and unequal access to technology [5,6].

While AI facilitates smarter energy distribution and reduces carbon footprints [6\u20138], its energy-intensive nature increases electricity demand, which may rely on fossil fuel sources, potentially exacerbating carbon emissions [9]. Simi- larly, AI-driven digital finance tools improve financial inclusion by lowering barriers to banking and credit access [10]. Yet their broader impact on GDP and patent generation in emerging economies remains underexplored. AI technologies also have the potential to enhance the efficiency and integration of renewable energy sources significantly [11]. By optimizing energy consumption patterns and improving climate modeling, AI can facilitate the transition to cleaner energy systems, thereby reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. [12]. This is particularly pertinent for E7 countries, where escalating energy demand and the shift towards renewable energy are imperative for sustainable development. Studies have demonstrated that AI can play a significant role in advancing sustainability efforts and supporting the creation of carbon-neutral technologies [13]. In addition, AI can significantly improve infrastructure quality by enabling predictive maintenance, smart city systems, and efficient energy use. Research shows that digital innovation supports infrastructure modernization and improves public service delivery, particularly in fast-urbanizing regions [14]. In the financial sector, AI fosters financial inclu- sion by providing innovative solutions that expand services to underserved populations, stimulating economic growth, and improving access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises [15]. Additionally, the integration of green finance and fintech plays a vital role in supporting economic sustainability in developing countries [16]. However, the rela- tionship between AI and sustainability is complex; while AI systems can increase carbon emissions due to their high energy consumption, they also present significant opportunities for emission reduction through enhanced efficiency [17].

However, the rela- tionship between AI and sustainability is complex; while AI systems can increase carbon emissions due to their high energy consumption, they also present significant opportunities for emission reduction through enhanced efficiency [17]. Balancing these aspects is essential for E7 nations to achieve their environmental targets. Moreover, technological innovation, measured by the number of patents (Tpatent), is a key factor in this study. Patents serve as indicators of research advancements and AI adoption, both of which influence environmental sustainability [18]. They reflect a country\u2019s technological progress and contribute to the development of energy-efficient solutions, AI-driven environmental monitoring systems, and smart energy grids [19]. Increased patent activity fosters innovation in renewable energy and carbon reduction strategies, strengthening AI\u2019s role in mitigating emissions and supporting sustainable economic growth. By incorporating Tpatent into this study, we gain a comprehensive understanding of how technological progress influences AI diffusion, energy efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Figure 1 illustrates AI adoption levels across E-7 countries from 2004 to 2024. The data source is Statista [20], which reports the AI adoption index as a percentage of adop- tion across sectors and institutions within each country. The percentage represents the proportion of organizations or sectors adopting AI technologies, as estimated through Statista\u2019s industry surveys and technological adoption reports. The initial phase from 2004 to 2014 reflects a relatively stagnant level of AI interest, indicating limited integration of AI technologies within these economies. However, after 2015, a gradual, upward trend emerges, corresponding with increased digitalization efforts, policy-driven AI strategies, and advancements in computational capabilities.

This trend reflects a transition from early niche experimentation to broader systemic integration, aligning with the multi-level perspective (MLP) framework applied in this study. This accelerating but heterogeneous adoption underscores a key research gap: the need to understand how determinants like infrastructure or emissions influence AI diffusion at different adoption stages. Addressing this issue motivates our use of a quantile-based empirical strategy to capture the varying effects across AI adoption levels in E-7 countries. Figure 1.

The study aim is to investigate the complex relationship of the determinants of ar- tificial intelligence (AI) adoption in E-7 nations by focusing on key variables such as energy structure (ES), infrastructure quality (INFRA), financial inclusion (FI), economic growth (GDP), carbon emissions (CE), population size (TP), and technological innovation T(Patents). It examines how these factors influence AI diffusion across different adoption levels. The analysis captures both direct effects and interdependencies, offering insights for policymaking in digitally transforming, high-growth economies.

Literature Review The use of artificial intelligence (AI) across various sectors has garnered significant attention in academic and policy-making circles, particularly regarding its potential to pro- mote sustainable development in emerging economies. This literature review synthesizes existing research on the impact of AI adoption within the E7 nations, including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey, concentrating on renewable energy, in- frastructure quality, financial inclusion, environmental sustainability, and innovation outputs. Recent studies have explored the multifaceted impact of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across economic, infrastructural, and environmental domains. The authors of [28] highlighted that AI technologies can optimize energy systems, promoting a higher share of renewable energy in national energy structures. The research of [29] emphasized that AI- driven digital platforms enhance infrastructure efficiency, especially in transport and ICT networks. Similarly, [30] found that AI-enabled financial services, including algorithmic credit scoring and mobile banking, improve financial inclusion, particularly in emerging markets. On the environmental front, [11] reported that AI tools can reduce CO2 emissions through smart grids and emission-monitoring systems.

Patent counts are a widely accepted proxy for technological innovation and have been used to measure a country\u2019s readiness to adopt and diffuse AI technologies [31]. Additionally, to enhance clarity and critical synthesis, we have included Appendix A Table A2: Summary Table of Literature Supporting Key Variables, which outlines the theoretical and empirical foundations of each explanatory variable along with key supporting references. 2.1. AI and Energy Systems A growing body of literature demonstrates that AI has the potential to revolutionize energy systems. Early studies [7] have shown that machine learning algorithms optimize renewable energy management, improve load forecasting, and enhance grid stability. The authors of [6] reported an \u201cinverted U-shaped\u201d relationship between AI deployment and carbon emissions in Chinese cities, indicating that while initial AI integration may increase emissions, further adoption ultimately enhances energy efficiency, leading to environmental benefits. However, most research has focused on isolated aspects such as energy efficiency or carbon emissions, without examining AI\u2019s broader role in transforming energy structures within emerging economies. AI technologies have become pivotal in optimizing energy consumption, refining climate modeling, and accelerating transitions to low-carbon energy sources. Evidence Sustainability 2025, 17, 5920 5 of 25 from previous studies suggests that AI-driven innovations significantly contribute to low-carbon energy transitions across various countries, underscoring AI\u2019s potential in fostering sustainable energy systems [32,33]. For example, in India, AI-powered solar forecasting has enhanced grid reliability [34], while Brazil\u2019s wind farms use AI-driven load- prediction models [35]. These insights emphasize AI\u2019s transformative role in reshaping energy frameworks and promoting environmental sustainability. H1.

Renewable energy and economic growth have a significant and positive effect on AI adoption. 2.2. AI and Infrastructure Infrastructure modernization is a key area where AI is driving substantial changes. Research has highlighted AI\u2019s contributions to intelligent transportation systems, predictive maintenance of utilities, and the development of smart cities [36,37]. These AI-driven ad- vancements enhance urban resilience, reduce operational costs, and improve infrastructure efficiency. However, the extent to which these improvements stimulate overall economic growth in developing nations remains unclear [2]. Moreover, much of the existing research focuses on developed economies, leaving a significant gap in understanding AI-induced infrastructure enhancements in E-7 countries. AI plays a multifaceted role in improving infrastructure quality by optimizing re- source allocation, facilitating predictive maintenance, and supporting the creation of smart urban environments [29]. These AI-driven solutions not only increase the efficiency and sustainability of infrastructure projects but also enhance public services, potentially driving economic expansion [38\u201340]. In Mexico, AI applications in traffic and waste systems have led to measurable urban efficiency gains [37]. Nevertheless, empirical studies examining AI-powered infrastructure improvements in E-7 nations are scarce, highlighting the need for further research into how AI interacts with local socioeconomic conditions in these emerging economies. 2.3. AI and Financial Inclusion AI-driven digital finance solutions, including mobile banking, algorithmic credit scoring, and blockchain-based platforms, have become key drivers of financial inclusion. Empirical research [10,33] suggests that AI can lower transaction costs and expand financial service access, particularly in underbanked regions.

Empirical research [10,33] suggests that AI can lower transaction costs and expand financial service access, particularly in underbanked regions. However, gaps remain in the literature regarding how these innovations influence broader economic performance and technolog- ical advancements, particularly in the context of E-7 economies, where factors like GDP play a crucial role in financial growth. AI-powered fintech solutions offer the potential to bridge financial disparities between urban and rural populations, thereby fostering inclusive and sustainable economic de- velopment. Recent study reviews suggest that AI-driven financial technologies not only enhance operational efficiency but also facilitate broader economic participation, contribut- ing to financial sustainability [30]. Indonesia\u2019s expansion of AI-driven mobile banking is linked with a rise in financial account ownership in rural areas [16]. Many studies examining fintech innovations in E-7 nations indicate that AI integration improves financial efficiency and supports economic growth, underscoring the need for further research in this domain [41,42]. H2. Poor Infrastructure and limited financial inclusion have a negative impact on AI adoption. 2.4. AI and Environmental Sustainability The environmental implications of AI, particularly its influence on carbon emissions (CE), have garnered significant academic attention. While some studies highlight AI\u2019s role Sustainability 2025, 17, 5920 6 of 25 in reducing CE through enhanced energy efficiency [6,43], others caution that AI\u2019s high computational demands and energy-intensive data centers could increase emissions [44]. Rapid urbanization in many E-7 countries intensifies energy consumption and emissions, yet AI-driven smart urban planning and public service optimization offer viable solutions for mitigating these environmental pressures. However, the existing literature often iso- lates the environmental impacts from the demographic factors, overlooking an integrated perspective on AI\u2019s influence on both urban and environmental dynamics [45,46].

The relationship between AI adoption and environmental sustainability is complex. Although AI systems can elevate energy consumption and emissions, they also present opportunities for emission reduction through efficiency gains and carbon-neutral technolo- gies. Research highlights the need to balance these competing forces to achieve net-zero emissions [47\u201349]. This nuanced understanding emphasizes the importance of integrated policy frameworks that incorporate technological innovations and demographic factors to maximize AI\u2019s role in sustainable development. Allam [50] highlights AI\u2019s dual role in smart city development, where optimized energy grids coexist with risks of digital exclu- sion if governance is inequitable [51\u201354]. This aligns with our findings on the nonlinear AI\u2013emissions relationship in E-7 nations, where early AI adoption exacerbates disparities before yielding net benefits. H3. Carbon emissions have a positive and significant effect on AI adoption. 2.5. AI and Innovation Patent data (Tpatent) serve as a key indicator of a nation\u2019s innovation capacity. Prior research [55] demonstrates that AI drives technological breakthroughs, leading to increased patent outputs. However, most studies focus on high-income countries and fail to exam- ine AI\u2019s influence on patent generation in emerging markets, where distinct regulatory, educational, and infrastructural conditions shape innovation pathways. AI adoption stimulates innovation by fostering technological advancements and enhancing patent activity. Studies suggest that AI-driven innovations contribute to energy resilience and correlate positively with higher innovation outputs [56,57].

Literature Gaps Despite the expanding literature on AI\u2019s role in energy management, infrastructure, financial inclusion, environmental sustainability, and innovation, several critical gaps remain: \u2022 Research on AI\u2019s environmental impacts is heavily skewed toward developed economies, with limited empirical work in the E-7 context. A recent study [59] demonstrates that in China\u2019s Yangtze River Delta, ICT usage exhibits an inverted U-shape relationship with SO2 emissions, whereas ICT supply consistently reduces pollution. This highlights the need to extend analysis beyond Europe/North America to emerging regions with distinct infrastructural constraints. \u2022 The moderating role of institutions remains underexplored in emerging economies. A recent research work [60] shows that better regulatory quality amplifies the negative impact of ICT service exports on CO2 emissions in OECD settings. Incorporating similar institutional controls in the rule of law ensures policy coherence is essential to understand AI\u2019s sustainability pathways in the E-7 framework.

Detailed analyses tailored to the legislative and institutional contexts of these countries are lacking, hindering the development of effective governance structures for AI integration [62]. \u2022 While AI could advance SDG 9 (Industry and Innovation), its environmental costs remain under-addressed. For example, China\u2019s reliance on coal-powered data centers for AI training contradicts its climate goals [63]. Similarly, Brazil\u2019s AI-driven defor- estation monitoring lacks integration with policies addressing ethical concerns, such as indigenous land rights [64]. This research contributes novel insights by integrating these diverse dimensions into a comprehensive empirical model. By focusing on the E-7 context and employing panel data techniques to simultaneously assess AI, ES, INFRA, FI, GDP, CE, TP, and Tpatent, the study offers a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of AI\u2019s diverse and far-reaching impacts. Moreover, it offers policy-relevant evidence to guide emerging economies in balancing rapid technological adoption with sustainable development goals. 2.7. Theoretical Framework To strengthen the theoretical foundation of this study, we integrate concepts from the multi-level perspective (MLP) [65], disruptive innovation theory [66], and institutional co-evolution theory [67]. The multi-level perspective (MLP) framework positions AI within sustainability transitions by emphasizing its influence at the niche level through innova- tion, at the regime level through structural constraints, and at the landscape level through macro-environmental pressures including climate change and digitalization. Disruptive in- novation theory further explains how AI can penetrate peripheral or underserved markets, gradually reshaping mainstream energy systems", "paper_id": "sustainability-17-05920", "section": ""}

Disruptive in- novation theory further explains how AI can penetrate peripheral or underserved markets, gradually reshaping mainstream energy systems by offering novel, efficient alternatives to legacy structures. Additionally, institutional co-evolution theory explains how AI adoption and policy reforms mutually reinforce sustainability transitions. For example, India\u2019s 2023 National AI Strategy links renewable energy targets to data center subsidies, creating feedback loops between innovation and regulation. Figure 2 presents the conceptual framework of this study, illustrating how the multi- level perspective (MLP), disruptive innovation theory, and institutional co-evolution theory link to the determinants of AI adoption in E-7 nations. It aligns each theoretical lens with the key explanatory variables and research hypotheses. Complementing these perspectives, institutional co-evolution theory provides a dy- namic lens to understand the mutual adaptation between AI technologies and policy environments. Although AI-enabled forecasting tools in renewable energy can drive regu- latory reforms, which in turn facilitate wider AI deployment, highlighting a feedback loop between innovation and institutional change. This co-evolutionary approach positions AI not as a passive tool but as an active agent of systemic transformation, whose impact is shaped by the agility of governance, regulatory openness, and institutional learning. Furthermore, recent studies have applied the multi-level perspective (MLP) to analyze energy transitions in various contexts, including Saudi Arabia [68], Russia and Ghana [69], Sustainability 2025, 17, 5920 8 of 25 and Western Australia [70].

Study Area Map Figure 3 illustrates the geographical distribution of the E-7 nations included in the analysis. This map provides a visual context for the regional diversity in AI adoption, infras- tructure development, and environmental outcomes. Highlighting the study area supports comparative analysis across emerging economies with distinct demographic, economic, and technological characteristics. The E7 group, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey, comprises dynamic economies that are rapidly embracing digital trans- formation and sustainable development. These nations actively invest in technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation, and renewable energy, each contributing uniquely to regional industrial upgrades and innovation. China and India stand out for their robust tech ecosystems and expansive digital infrastructures, while the other E7 countries play essential roles in advancing industrial modernization and economic resilience. This visual representation reinforces our analysis by clearly mapping the key players in emerging market innovation regions and highlighting the policy initiatives that support sustainable technological growth. 3.2. Empirical Framework The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally altering industrial land- scapes, driving economic evolution, and spurring technological innovation. This study delves into the primary factors influencing AI adoption within the E-7 nations, such as China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia, and Turkey, over the period from 2004 to 2024.

The E-7 nations, comprising some of the world\u2019s largest emerging economies, play a crucial role in global GDP, population, and energy consumption, making them highly relevant for examining the developmental and environmental implications of AI adoption. These countries are rapidly integrating AI technologies, providing an ideal context to explore its transformative impact. Focusing on the E-7 group also minimizes cross-country heterogene- ity, as their relatively similar institutional and economic contexts enhance the reliability of econometric analysis. Additionally, targeting this specific group yields more actionable policy insights for countries at comparable stages of development. Broadening the scope to include a wider set of countries could compromise analytical depth and introduce biases due to varied technological, institutional, and economic frameworks. The MMQREG model accounts for E-7 heterogeneity, but future work could integrate machine learning such as causal forests to unpack nonlinear threshold effects. Figure 3.

The foundational econometric model is articulated as follows: AIit = \u03b1i + X\u2032 it\u03b2 + \u0000\u03b4i + Z\u2032 it\u03b3 \u0001 Uit (1) In this equation, AIit denotes the AI adoption index for country i at time t; X\u2032 it repre- sents a vector of explanatory variables, including ES, INFRA, FI, GDP, CE, TP, and Tpatent; \u0000\u03b4i + Z\u2032 it\u03b3 \u0001 accounts for heterogeneous covariance effects; and Uit is the error term captur- Sustainability 2025, 17, 5920 10 of 25 ing random disturbances. To address heteroskedasticity and enhance the robustness of estimations, all variables are log-transformed. Figure 4. Study estimation steps. Before model estimation, it is imperative to assess the stationarity of the panel dataset to avoid spurious regression outcomes. This assessment employs the cross-sectional de- pendence (CD) test by [74,75], the cross-sectionally augmented im, Pesaran, and Shi (CIPS) test, and the cross-sectionally augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller (CADF) [76] test. The unit root testing equation is specified as the following: \u2206Yit = \u00b5i + \u03b3iYi,t\u22121 + p \u2211 j=1 \u03c1j\u2206Yi,t\u2212j + \u03b5it (2) Here, \u2206Yit represents the variable under examination and \u00b5i is the country-specific intercept, while \u03b5it denotes the error term. If non-stationarity is detected, first-differencing is applied to achieve stationarity.

Detecting significant cross-sectional dependence necessitates the application of panel quantile regression methods to account for these interdependencies. To ascertain the existence of long-term relationships between AI adoption and its determinants, the [77] panel cointegration test is conducted, as represented by the following: Yit = \u03b1i + X\u2032 it\u03b2 + (\u03b4i + Zit\u03b3)Uit (4) Sustainability 2025, 17, 5920 11 of 25 In this context, \u03b1i and \u03b4i capture country-specific effects, while Uit accounts for short- term deviations. Confirming cointegration indicates that AI adoption and its determinants share a long-run equilibrium relationship, justifying the use of long-term estimation techniques. Given the nonlinear and heterogeneous nature of AI adoption, the MMQR approach is implemented to estimate conditional quantiles while addressing outliers and asymmetric distributions. The MMQR model is specified as follows: Qy(\u03c4/Xit) = (\u03b1i + \u03b4i(\u03c4)) + Xit\u03b2 + Zit\u03b3q(\u03c4) (5) Here, Qy(\u03c4/Xit) represents the conditional quantile function of AI adoption; (\u03b1i + \u03b4i(\u03c4)) denotes the intercept capturing country-specific effects; and Xit includes the explanatory variables ES, INFRA, FI, GDP, CE, TP, and Tpatent.

Data Sources and Description Table 1 summarizes the key variables and data sources used to analyze the AI adop- tion across E-7 nations from 2004 to 2024. It includes the AI adoption index (AI) from Statista, which measures the percentage of AI adoption; the energy structure (ES) indicat- ing the share of total energy derived from renewable sources from British petroleum; an infrastructure index (INFRA) based on PCA provided by the World Development Indi- cators; and a financial inclusion index (FI) from the World Bank. Additionally, the study incorporates macroeconomic and environmental variables GDP (% annual growth), CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita), total population (TP), and number of patents (Tpatent) to comprehensively capture the interplay between technology, economic growth, environ- mental performance, and innovation in these emerging economies. In addtion, we measure technological innovation using patent counts, a widely accepted proxy in empirical litera- ture [78\u201380], as patents represent concrete innovation outcomes rather than inputs like R&D. They offer standardized, comparable data across countries and time, particularly relevant for AI-related technologies where formal intellectual property signals both innovation and market readiness [31]. This choice also ensures data consistency across E-7 nations from 2004 to 2024.

The index aggregates data from industry surveys, policy disclosures, and digital engagement metrics, capturing macro-level trends in AI uptake. While we recognize the potential measurement bias in countries like China and India, where AI may be concentrated in select sectors, the index is intended to reflect overall national interest and diffusion, not sector-specific deployment. To address heterogeneity, we include country fixed effects and validate the index\u2019s consistency through correlations with complementary indicators such as ICT infrastructure and R&D intensity. Our approach aligns with prior empirical studies that use similar proxies to measure AI readiness or digital transition at the country level [81,82].

By embedding institutional digital asymmetries into our analysis, we move beyond descriptive empiricism, offering a nuanced understanding of how AI diffusion and environmental impacts are shaped in emerging economies with uneven ICT maturity.

The results of the Jarque\u2013Bera (JB) test indicate significant deviations from normality across all variables, highlighting substantial heterogeneity in economic, technological, and environmental conditions among E-7 nations. This lack of normal distribution suggests the presence of skewness and kurtosis, reinforcing the need for advanced econometric techniques that account for such distributional irregularities. Given the diverse structural characteristics of these economies, a one-size-fits-all policy approach may not be effective. While common objectives, such as fostering AI adoption and sustainable economic growth, remain central, the pathways to achieving these goals must be tailored to each nation\u2019s unique context. The JB test outcomes further validate the applicability of MMQREG, which accommodates non-normality and allows for a more precise examination of the heterogeneous impacts of key determinants across different quantiles. The results of the cross-sectional dependence (CD) test in Table 3 confirm significant interdependence between variables across the panel. The highly significant coefficients and p-values (all at 0.000) indicate the presence of cross-sectional dependence in AI, GDP, energy structure (ES), infrastructure (INFRA), financial inclusion (FI), total population (TP), technology patents (Tpatent), and carbon emissions (CE). These findings suggest that economic and environmental dynamics in one country are strongly influenced by those in others, reinforcing the necessity for coordinated policy measures among nations. Ignoring cross-sectional dependence could lead to biased estimates, underscoring the importance of employing econometric models that account for such interdependencies. Employing methodologies like the method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) can effectively address these interdependencies, leading to more robust and reliable results in analyzing AI adoption determinants among the E-7 countries.

The Westerlund cointegration test in Table 6 evaluates whether the variables maintain a long-run relationship despite being non-stationary at the level. The results show that Gt (0.493, p = 0.000) and Pt (0.452, p = 0.000) are statistically significant, confirming the existence of cointegration. However, Ga (\u22120.160, p = 1.000) and Pa (0.265, p = 0.997) are insignificant, suggesting inconsistencies in panel-wide cointegration. Since at least two key statistics indicate cointegration, we reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration and conclude that the variables share a stable long-term relationship. Table 7 reports the MMQREG results examining the heterogeneous determinants of AI adoption in E-7 nations across different quantiles. The results indicate that GDP consistently exerts a positive effect on AI adoption, with the coefficient increasing from 0.028 in the base (location) model to 0.085 at the highest quantile 9, implying that stronger economic growth is associated with higher AI uptake among countries already advanced in AI integration. These findings are aligned with [87], although these results did not support the results of [88]. In contrast, INFRA yields robust negative coefficients across all quantiles, \u22120.604 in the location model and \u22120.720 at quantile_9, suggesting that infrastructure inhibits the diffusion of cutting-edge AI technologies [89]. The negative coefficient for infrastructure (INFRA: \u22120.604) reflects a critical E-7 paradox: legacy systems, such as Indonesia\u2019s 35% broadband gap, hinder AI adoption despite nominal digital readiness.

Moreover, financial inclusion also shows a consistent negative effect on AI adoption. The results reveal that both infrastructure quality and financial inclusion exhibit negative and significant impacts on AI adoption at lower and median quantiles, suggesting that weak infrastructure and limited financial access constrain the diffusion of AI technologies across E-7 nations. This evidence supports our second hypothesis (H2), confirming that poor infrastructure and limited financial inclusion negatively affect AI adoption. Table 5. CADF test.

Energy structure shows a markedly positive and significant impact that grows substan- tially at higher quantiles, from 0.102 in the location model to 0.806 at quantile_75, indicating that a greater reliance on renewable energy sources is strongly related to higher levels of AI adoption. These findings support our first hypothesis (H1), confirming that renewable energy has a positive and significant effect on AI adoption. These results align with [9,90]. Additionally, TP consistently demonstrates negative impacts on AI adoption, while the effect of Tpatent remains negative and significant across quantiles, highlighting that higher patent activity does not necessarily correspond with increased AI diffusion. This is also conceptually linked to the institutional co-evolution framework, which acknowledges the lag between innovation output and institutional readiness. Finally, CE exhibits a positive effect at lower quantiles that diminishes at higher quantiles, suggesting a more complex interplay between environmental conditions and AI uptake. This pattern supports our third hypothesis (H3), confirming that carbon emissions are positively and significantly associated with AI adoption in E-7 nations.

Figure 5. MMQREG results showing key variables influencing AI adoption in E-7. Sustainability 2025, 17, 5920 18 of 25 To enhance AI adoption, policymakers should focus on improving infrastructure, expanding financial accessibility, and ensuring the smooth integration of technological ad- vancements. Additionally, as AI adoption shifts from industrial use to broader applications, strategies should emphasize sustainability and efficiency to support long-term AI growth. The robustness check using the Driscoll\u2013Kraay method in Table 8 confirms the stability of our estimates in the AI adoption model for E-7 nations. The results indicate that a 1% increase in GDP is associated with a 0.032% increase in AI adoption (p = 0.011), suggesting a positive effect of economic growth on technology uptake. In contrast, the energy structure (ES) variable has a large and highly significant coefficient of 1.117 (p = 0.008), implying that a higher share of renewable energy substantially drives AI adoption. Meanwhile, both infrastructure (INFRA) and financial inclusion (FI) exhibit robust negative impacts, with coefficients of \u22120.433 (p = 0.003) and \u22120.228 (p = 0.004), respectively, indicating that conventional infrastructure limitations and challenges in financial inclusion are associated with lower levels of AI diffusion.

Overall, the Driscoll\u2013Kraay robust standard errors ensure the consistency and reliability of our findings about the factors influencing AI adoption in the E-7 nations. These results align with the multi-level perspective (MLP) framework, in which AI adoption is influenced by niche-level innovations such as renewable energy integration, constrained by regime-level barriers including weak infrastructure and limited financial inclusion, and accelerated by landscape-level forces such as economic growth and environ- mental pressures. This layered interpretation emphasizes the need for coordinated policy interventions at all levels to support sustainable AI transitions in E-7 nations. Figure 6. Graphical representation of results.

Conclusions The E-7 nations, representing the world\u2019s most dynamic emerging economies, stand at a critical juncture where the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) could either catalyze sustainable development or exacerbate existing environmental and economic disparities. Despite the potential of AI to optimize renewable energy systems, enhance infrastructure efficiency, and expand financial access, the path to its integration is fraught with systemic obstacles.", "paper_id": "sustainability-17-05920", "section": ""}

Despite the potential of AI to optimize renewable energy systems, enhance infrastructure efficiency, and expand financial access, the path to its integration is fraught with systemic obstacles. This study analyzes the main enablers of AI adoption across E-7 nations, focusing on the roles of energy structure, infrastructure, financial inclusion, economic growth, carbon emissions, population, and innovation. Our goal is to unravel the complex interplay between these factors and AI adoption to inform strategies that align technological progress with sustainability. Our MMQREG analysis identifies renewable energy (energy structure) and economic growth (GDP) as pivotal catalysts for AI diffusion across E-7 nations. A 1% increase in renewable energy share (ES) boosts AI adoption by 0.806%. Conversely, infrastruc- ture deficiencies and financial constraints consistently impede progress, where each 1% infrastructure improvement correlates with a 0.720% decline in adoption, while a 1% expansion in financial inclusion reduces uptake by 0.228%. Carbon emissions exhibit a J-curve relationship; a 1% emission increase accelerates adoption by 1.228% during initial deployment phases, though this effect reverses as efficiency gains materialize. Furthermore, patent activity demonstrates a negative relationship with adoption, indicating significant innovation\u2013commercialization disconnects. This quantile-based perspective advances theoretical understanding of AI-sustainability transitions in emerging economies. E-7 nations leverage AI for sustainable development, yet face trade-offs between technological advancement and environmental costs. AI adoption exacerbates carbon emissions due to energy-intensive infrastructure, but sustained integration enables effi- ciency gains that mitigate environmental harm. However, systemic barriers, such as weak institutional linkages between patent output and commercialization, prevent innovation from translating into scalable AI solutions. These insights highlight the urgency of poli- cies that address infrastructural gaps, accelerate renewable energy transitions, and bridge innovation-to-adoption pathways to align AI", "paper_id": "sustainability-17-05920", "section": ""}

These insights highlight the urgency of poli- cies that address infrastructural gaps, accelerate renewable energy transitions, and bridge innovation-to-adoption pathways to align AI adoption with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 5.1. Policy Implications To address the pressing environmental challenges, E-7 nations should consider the following policy recommendations: Sustainability 2025, 17, 5920 20 of 25 1. Expanding renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind, will reduce dependence on fossil fuels. AI technologies can optimize energy consumption, enhance grid efficiency, and support the transition to sustainable energy. 2. Modernizing smart energy grids, expanding high-speed internet access, and develop- ing AI-friendly ecosystems are crucial for seamless AI integration across industries, particularly in the energy and financial sectors. 3. Governments should promote financial instruments such as green bonds and climate funds to attract investment in AI-powered sustainability projects, mobilizing capital for smart grids, emissions monitoring, and energy-efficient industries. 4. Fiscal incentives, including carbon taxes and subsidies for AI-driven clean energy solutions, can drive industries toward sustainable practices while promoting economic and environmental resilience. 5. Develop sectoral AI hubs like Java\u2013Sumatra to commercialize patents and overcome adoption barriers. Launch training programs to certify workers in AI-for-sustainability by 2030. 6. Establish an E-7 AI Sustainability Consortium to share best practices in green AI deployment and policy design 5.2. Study Limitations Endogeneity risks, such as bidirectional GDP\u2013AI links, may persist despite MMQREG\u2019s robustness.
