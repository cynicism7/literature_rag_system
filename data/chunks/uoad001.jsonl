In the 20th century, various disciplines of materials science developed rapidly and enabled the rational develop\u00ad ment of functional materials. Organic chemistry,1 inorganic chemistry,2 supramolecular chemistry,3 coordination chemis\u00ad try,4 polymer chemistry,5 other materials sciences,6 and biore\u00ad lated sciences7 have all made significant contributions and continue to meet diverse demands in the energy,8 environ\u00ad ment,9 biomedical,10 and other fields.11 These developments in science have shown that matter can be rationally created from atoms and molecules. However, this is not simple. It has become clear that the nanoscale struc\u00ad tures and effects of the same material can significantly change the material functions. In other words, to obtain higher func\u00ad tions, it is necessary not only to synthesize materials but also to control their internal structures. This requires a better under\u00ad standing of phenomena in the atomic, molecular, and nano\u00ad scale regions. This has become the new global challenge. Nanotechnology, which has developed rapidly since the latter half of the 20th century, has been a powerful driving force be\u00ad hind this trend.

The goal of nanoarchi\u00ad tectonics is to build functional material systems by architect\u00ad ing atoms, molecules, and nanomaterials as building blocks.15 It integrates nanotechnology, organic chemistry, in\u00ad organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, supramolecular chem\u00ad istry, coordination chemistry, and materials science, as well as microfabrication technology and biological sciences.16 The process of building functional molecules from nano is based on atom/molecule manipulation, chemical and physical material transformation, self-assembly/self-organization, alignment and orientation by external fields, nano/microfabri\u00ad cation, and biological processing, which are selected and com\u00ad bined in the nanoarchitectonics processes.17 Therefore, it is often a multistep process and tends to form asymmetric and hierarchical structures.18 Compared with self-assembly based on simple equilibrium processes, this process has the potential for a variety of structural architectures. In addition, the under\u00ad lying nano-level interactions involve uncertainties such as thermal fluctuations, stochastic distributions, and quantum effects. Therefore, rather than building up the interactions, the entire effects are harmonized.19 The formation of hierarch\u00ad ical structures and their coexistence with uncertainties such as thermal fluctuations share characteristics with the high level of structural organization in living organisms.20 As described above, the methodology of nanoarchitectonics is general and not bound to specific materials or purposes. Therefore, it has a wide range of applications, as exemplified by the wide variety of subjects selected in the papers with nanoarchitectonics in the title.

Of course, it is unlikely that this method for everything will be achieved instantly. The organization of functional structures in living organisms, with similar processes, has been won over by billions of years of evolution. However, nanoarchitectonics-like studies have already been conducted on parts of it.

This simple nanoarchitectonics of atoms can lead to synapse-like functions such as short-term plasticity and long-term potentiation.34 New materials are also created through nanoarchitectonics by designing and gathering atoms in precise numbers and types. Materials with anisotropic and quantum effects are also synthesized by collecting atoms in specific nanospaces. For example, Yamamoto et al.35 reported the nanoarchitec\u00ad tonics of clusters of a specific number and type of atoms using the controlled space of dendrimers. There are many possibil\u00ad ities for atomistic nanoarchitectonics. It is difficult to focus on specific ones. Here, a limited number of possibilities with only a few examples are described. High-entropy alloys have attracted attention as a product of nanoarchitectonics,36 in which atoms are mixed together. In particular, alloys in which 5 or more elements are mixed in near equal concentrations are often called high-entropy al\u00ad loys.37 In high-entropy alloys, the composition can be freely changed, and properties such as specific catalytic properties emerge accordingly. Control of the structure is necessary to realize diverse applications. It is desirable to precisely nano\u00ad architectonize high-entropy alloys into ultrathin film low- dimensional nanostructures.

However, this is not always easy due to the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of high-entropy alloys. Huang, Guo, and coworkers reported a method for creating subnanometer ribbons of ultrathin high- entropy alloys (Fig. 2).38 In addition to the example in Fig. 2 (PtPdIrRuAg high-entropy alloy), they successfully fabricated quaternary (PtPdIrRuAg), quintet (PtPdIrRuAuAg), quater\u00ad nary (PtPdIrRuAuRhAg), and octet (PtPdIrRuAuRhOsAg) subnanometer ribbons using Ag nanowires as templates with different metal precursors. Galvanic exchange reactions with different metal precursors induced nucleation of different met\u00ad al atoms. Coreduction of different metal precursors on this template was carried out. Subnanometer ribbons of ultrathin high-entropy alloys were then prepared by removing the Ag core. This synthesis method allows for a flexible tuning of the composition and concentration in the high-entropy alloy subnanometer ribbons and the construction of a library. As a result, it becomes possible to explore materials with even bet\u00ad ter electrocatalytic properties. Density functional theory cal\u00ad culations have revealed the role of each element and the conditions for higher electroactivity of high-entropy alloy sub\u00ad nanometer ribbons. For example, the concentration of highly dynamic reducing elements (Pd, Pt, Ag, Au) is important for electrical activity. On the other hand, relatively inert oxidizing elements (Ir, Ru, Rh, Os) promote efficient electron transfer between sites but can cause localized aggregation.

They fabricated optical waveguide slabs by impregnating these quantum dots with polydimethylsiloxane.

Such Stokes shift engineering of quantum dots is an attractive approach for creating materials with high luminescence effi\u00ad ciency by reducing reabsorption losses.

However, even with that history, not every\u00ad thing has been achieved. There is still room for challenges in molecular nanoarchitectonics based on organic synthesis, such as the synthesis of molecules with topological specificity.43 In contrast, what has emerged in recent years is a coupling tech\u00ad nique between nanotechnology and organic synthesis. Local probe chemistry44 has been proposed as an organic synthesis method that uses the tip of an STM, a key tool in nanotechnol\u00ad ogy. This is like using a tip to pick up a reactant and press it to a specific section of another molecule for an addition reaction. The stimulation from the tip can also induce a polymerization reaction with a diacetylene monomer laid down on the surface from a specific location.45 These molecular syntheses are dis\u00ad tinct from conventional organic synthesis, which is deter\u00ad mined by thermodynamics and other factors.

These molecular nanoarchitectonics are expected to be extended to the materials science of novel hetero-nanographenes and others. In addition to the further development of molecular nano\u00ad architectonics through organic chemistry as described above, there have been a growing number of attempts to architect molecules on solid substrates using a combination of nano\u00ad technological observation techniques. This series of studies is referred to as \u201con-surface synthesis.\u201d A typical example of such an attempt is the construction of carbon nanostructures with sp hybridization through acetylene homocoupling at the surface. However, tactics to increase the efficiency of linear acetylene couplings are not well established. In contrast, Bj\u00f6rk, Zhang, Chi, and coworkers investigated the acetylene homocoupling reaction of polar terminal alkynes on Au(111) using bond-resolved scanning probe microscopy (Fig. 5).49 The substitution of benzene with pyridine signifi\u00ad cantly inhibits the cyclic trimerization pathway. In particular, the pyridine nitrogen modification significantly alters the coupling motif in the initial C\u2013C coupling step (head-to-head, head-to-tail, etc.). This favors linear coupling over cyclotrime\u00ad rization. As a result, linear coupling is facilitated and aligned N-doped grapyridine nanowires are produced. The pyridine N-doped graphdiyne nanowires produced are expected to have high catalytic performance, but the details are not well understood.

Molecular nanoarchitectonics in multilayered structures, rather than on a single surface layer, has also been investigated by Ma, Tan, Wang, and coworkers. (Fig. 6).50 In this case, topologically nontrivial graphene nanoribbons were grown directly via multistep coupling in the second layer as well as in the surface layer.

This is a useful insight for quantum computing and quantum sensing. Proper molecular nanoarchitectonics to create the desired electronic states is also important. Electron doping is an essential process for the development of n-type organic thermoelectric materials. The importance of searching for efficient n-type dop\u00ad ants is also an important target in molecular nanoarchitectonics. Takimiya and coworkers have synthesized and characterized new candidate molecules as n-type dopants (Fig. 7).51 The elec\u00ad tron doping ability is highly dependent on the molecular con\u00ad formation in the solid state. In their design, planar molecules consisting of 2,2\u2032-bis(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) moieties can be doped into poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline). Conformational considerations suggest that the planarity of their dopant molecules improves their electron doping ability. The findings obtained here may provide useful information for the molecular design of superior n-type dopants in the develop\u00ad ment of organic thermoelectric applications. Molecular nanoarchitectonics, the architecture of molecules themselves, is undoubtedly important.

Supramolecular nanoarchitectonics can be used to assemble highly functional objects such as microrobots. Autonomous microrobots are at the forefront of biomedical research. It is expected that microrobots will be able to accomplish specific tasks at the intracellular level. Pumera and coworkers report on the nanoarchitectonics of microrobots using the organic pigments quinacridone and indigo (Fig. 8).54 The introduction of protecting groups into these pigments prevents hydrogen bonding of the pigment molecules, making them soluble in or\u00ad ganic solvents. This allows nanoarchitectonics into micropar\u00ad ticles in solution by hot injection. The microrobots were fabricated by an asymmetric deposition of platinum on these dye particles.

These examples demonstrate the potential for fabricating organic dye-based microrobots for biomedical applications by using the principles of nanoarchitectonics. There is also the possibil\u00ad ity of decorating organic dyes with biomolecules and utilizing their original photoelectrochemical activity for function. Such a nanoarchitectonics approach could also add various add\u00ad itional functionalities to microrobots for biomedical applications. In supramolecular nanoarchitectonics, the shape of the ag\u00ad gregates formed depends on subtle differences in the structure of the unit molecules. For example, it is of interest from a bio\u00ad logical point of view how lipid molecules form aggregate structures depending on their original molecular structure. As is often the case in natural lipid structures, asymmetric tails in a single lipid molecule are expected to influence the struc\u00ad ture and properties of the aggregate. As a model, Zhu, Liu, and coworkers investigated the self-assembly behavior of arti\u00ad ficial building blocks composed of asymmetric tail portions (Fig. 9).55 Several Fmoc-protected ornithine lipids with asym\u00ad metric alkyl tails were synthesized and their assembly struc\u00ad tures were investigated.

The mode of inter\u00ad action is controlled by van der Waals interactions between alkyl tails, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking between Fmoc motifs, and hydrogen bonds formed by 3 amide bonds in the lipid bilayer. The asym\u00ad metry of the lipid tails causes an imbalance between inter- or intralayer \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, resulting in various interaction modes. These studies provide some insight into understanding the as\u00ad sociation behavior of lipids in biological systems due to their asymmetric structures, and are also useful for the design of various functional materials. For example, they may provide new strategies for the rational design of supramolecular chiral luminescent materials. New strategies for rationally modulat\u00ad ing the chiral and luminescent properties of supramolecular materials may be established, such as methods for utilizing such strategies in tunable circularly polarized luminescence materials. As described above, the morphology of an aggregate can be controlled by subtle changes in the structure of the molecule. In other cases, very simple molecules can give rise to extremely diverse forms of aggregation. For example, the aggregation of fullerene molecules (C60, C70), which are single-element, 0D molecules, can form 1D,56 2D,57 3D,58 and hierarchically structured59 assemblies.

The covalent incorpor\u00ad ation of the melamine/ethylenediamine component of the fullerene rosette and the inclusion of a multilayer-like nano\u00ad structure are thought to be responsible for the high selectivity for formic acid. Nanomaterials with hollow structures are expected to perform various functions in materials engineering.61 Nanoarchitectonics is also an attractive target to freely create such hollow structures. Chen et al.62 have successfully synthe\u00ad sized fullerene (C60) assemblies with different hollow struc\u00ad tures using a kinetically controlled liquid\u2013liquid interface precipitation method (Fig. 11).

Simultaneously, in situ-generated ethylenediamine\u2013 sulfur droplets were applied as an egg yolk. Removal by washing after formation of the egg yolk-shell structure yields a hollow structure.

This nanoarchitectonics strategy opens new possibilities for customizing high-performance carbon superstructures. In supramolecular nanoarchitectonics, various structures are created by assembling and organizing unit molecules. The morphology of the assembled structures can be controlled in various ways by the subtle structural differences of the unit molecules. Even with single-element, 0D units such as fuller\u00ad enes, the assembly structure can be freely modified by tuning the reactions and kinetics of the assembly process. The result\u00ad ing structures are expected to have many functions, ranging from advanced nano-functions such as micro-motors to prac\u00ad tical applications such as sensing and energy applications. The examples given here are only of limited number, and a wide variety of functions have been reported for the products of supramolecular nanoarchitectonics. 5.

Chen et al.65 have developed a method to produce platinum particles in the form of nanoflowers, nanowires, nanotubes, etc. by chemical reduction of platinum under a delicate combination of ethylenediamine, isopropyl alcohol, and water (Fig. 13). In this methodology, NaBH4 is used as a reducing agent to rapidly form Pt nanoparticles. Aggregation is then promoted by the addition of ethylenedi\u00ad amine. The adsorption of ethylenediamine molecules stabil\u00ad izes the Pt nanoparticles in solution and increases the hydrophilicity of the Pt nanoparticles. The presence of 2 ami\u00ad no groups can also link the Pt nanoparticles. The sheet struc\u00ad ture observed in the Pt nanoflowers as a constituent structure may be caused by the minimization of surface energy by in\u00ad creasing the interfacial area. This Pt nanoparticle assembly morphology can be easily controlled by tuning the hydropho\u00ad bic/hydrophilic interactions by adding isopropanol and H2O. Since the surface hydrophobicity of Pt nanoparticles is increased compared with Pt-ethylenediamine species, nano\u00ad wires, nanosheets, nanotubes, and nanotubes can be formed by simply changing the H2O content.

The Pt nanoparticles prepared here showed better oxygen reduction reaction activity than Pt black. This is the ef\u00ad fect of their hierarchical structures.

These results establish a nano\u00ad architectonics methodology for building hierarchical morph\u00ad ologies of Pt using Pt nanoparticles as building blocks. Iridium-based electrocatalysts are promising materials for acidic oxygen evolution reactions. Inorganic nanoarchitecton\u00ad ics for high performance has been investigated. Li, Yu, Zhao, and coworkers reported a nanoconfined self-assembly strategy using block copolymers forming stable end-confined lamellar micelles.66 Ultrathin Ir-IrOx/C nanosheets with ordered inter\u00ad layer spaces were synthesized to facilitate oxygen-evolving re\u00ad actions (Fig. 14). First, a liquid\u2013liquid microphase separation of the different components occurs because of the evaporation of tetrahydrofuran. The block copolymer, iridium precursor, and acetylacetonate undergo nanoconfined self-assembly. These processes result in the formation of lamellar organic\u2013 inorganic composite micelles. Continuous evaporation of the residual tetrahydrofuran and water at 100 \u00b0C yields an organic\u2013inorganic iridium composite. Further calcination in an argon atmosphere forms an ordered mesoporous Ir-IrOx/C catalyst.

This nanoarchitectonics strategy paves the way for the design of high-performance 2D ordered mesoporous electrocatalysts. Mathesh et al.67 developed an enzyme-powered 2D nanobot that achieves active motion at very low fuel concentrations (0.003% H2O2) by a simple strategy based on soft nano- architectonics (Fig. 15). The 2D nanobots were fabricated by non-covalent nanoarchitectonics based on graphene oxide. The nanobots exhibited efficient positive chemotaxis. The vel\u00ad ocity of the 2D nanobots increased with increasing fuel concen\u00ad tration and decreased with time. Therefore, the chemotaxis behavior was based on the fuel gradient. Furthermore, due to the buoyancy of the solute, the 2D nanobots showed the ability to swim against gravity. As part of these capabilities of 2D bots, a proof-of-concept study of environmental remediation without the need for external forces was conducted. Specifically, the 2D nanobots were able to remove methylene blue dye in situ with 85% efficiency. Two-dimensional nanobots have a wide range of potential applications ranging from biomedical to plant nanobiotechnology. To meet those demands, it is important to design and develop nanobots with the necessary capabilities through nanoarchitectonics.

It acts as a chemical plant for synthesizing a series of new nanocrystals that are difficult to achieve with conventional bulk solution-based strategies. The volume of the individual reactors fits the zeptolitre range. Within them is a uniquely confined environment that allows for directional inward crys\u00ad tallization that differs from that of bulk solutions. As a result, products are obtained that are difficult to achieve in ordinary systems based on bulk solutions. Nanocrystals of mono-, bi-, tri-metallic, and even semiconducting materials with tunable internal structures can be generated.

Govindaraju and coworkers achieved them by copper chelation and self-assembly of amyloid \u03b2-peptides.72 In this case, thermodynamically stable nanosheets and kineti\u00ad cally controlled micelle-like structures are formed. Upon add\u00ad ition of CuII, the peptide fibrils first self-assemble into nanosheets. Further, continuous addition of CuII results in the formation of micelle-like core-shell structures.

This is a nanoarchitectonics reproduction of cellular function. The nanoarchitectonics of artificial biomimetic systems has the potential to achieve outputs that break the limits of natural reactions. Mimicking nature's unique structures and ingeni\u00ad ous functions is a challenging task, but attempts to accomplish it have been reported. Li and coworkers have artificially integrated multiple biochemical reactions via molecular as\u00ad semblies (Fig. 21).77 Inspired by the natural chloroplast com\u00ad partment structure, they designed hierarchical SiO2 nanosponges. The nanosponges were co-assembled with pho\u00ad toacid molecules and liposome-ATP synthase to form organ\u00ad ic\u2013inorganic hybrid nanocomposites for achieving photophosphorylation output control. Upon light irradiation, protons are generated by photoacid generators in the confined space. As a result, the enzyme ATPase, encapsulated in lipo\u00ad somes, performs ATP synthesis. In other words, it can mimic the photophosphorylation process in vitro. Massive ATP pro\u00ad duction in vitro could be demonstrated.

It also provides good design guidelines for new supramolecu\u00ad lar assemblies to construct various biomimetic nanosystems. A hybrid structure that performs a nanozyme-catalyzed cas\u00ad cade reaction with an oxidative phosphorylation function mimicking mitochondria was reported by Li and coworkers (Fig. 22).78 Hollow silica microspheres containing trapped gold nanoparticles were synthesized. The gold nanoparticles possess 2 enzyme-like activities corresponding to glucose oxi\u00ad dase and peroxidase. In the presence of oxygen, glucose is con\u00ad verted to gluconic acid by a gold nanoparticle\u2013catalyzed cascade reaction. As a result, the ambient pH value decreases and a proton gradient is created. The protons then diffuse across the proteoliposome membrane coating on the surface of the hollow silica microspheres, which promotes the synthe\u00ad sis of ATP by ATP synthase. The hydrogen peroxide produced at the same time is consumed by the gold nanoparticles. The latter effect prevents oxidation of the ATP synthase. This nanoarchitectonized system exhibited high oxidative phos\u00ad phorylation activity comparable to that of natural mitochon\u00ad dria. The natural\u2013artificial hybrid prototype enables ATP production from bioenergy such as glucose. Application of this system will contribute to the development of biofunctions powered by ATP.

Rather, Fei, Li, and coworkers have nanoarchitectonically cre\u00ad ated a system that uses boric acid as fuel and stores energy in a cell-like supramolecular structure (Fig. 23).79 In the developed system, the biomimetic supramolecular architecture uses poly\u00ad electrolyte microcapsules supporting ATP synthase\u2013containing liposomes. In this system, the polyol forms cyclic boronates, which release protons from the boric acid. As a result, a con\u00ad trolled proton gradient across the lipid membrane is established. The incorporated ATP synthase is driven to produce the bio\u00ad chemical fuel ATP from adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate. In total, boric acid is used as a chemical source to drive the ATP synthase. The rate of ATP production can be adjusted by polyol selection.

ATP synthase proteoliposomes were then coated onto the micro\u00ad capsules by fusion. Upon light irradiation, the bacteriorho\u00ad dopsin inside the microcapsule pumps protons from the inside to the outside. As a result, a proton gradient is formed throughout the proteoliposome.

There are approaches that hybridize cells with artificial materials or artificially organize cells. There is also nanoarchitectonics, which encapsulates living cells with artificial materials. For example, cyborg cells in which living cells are covered with LbL membranes have been proposed.81 Hybrid structures in which living cells are covered with exogenous substances are also referred to as \u201ccell-in-shell biohybrid structures.\u201d82 Of particular interest is the enhancement of the biological functions of cells through encapsulation and the introduction of entirely new functions. Choi and coworkers proposed in this report a method for introducing a series of enzymes into a cytoprotective artificial shell. This artificial shell can perform enzymatic cascade reac\u00ad tions and exogenous reactions that are beneficial to the cells inside (Fig. 25).83 Specifically, living cells were nano- encapsulated with supramolecular organometallic complexes of Fe3+ and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid. A series of en\u00ad zymes were embedded in situ in the shells without loss of cata\u00ad lytic activity. Confinement of the reaction intermediates in the internal voids of the nanoshells enhanced the catalytic efficiency of the multienzyme cascade reaction. Cells nano- encapsulated with enzyme-containing shells acquired the ability to convert toxic chemicals into nutrients. For example, the ability to convert the lethal octyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside to D-glucose has been conferred, and the cells have autonomous cytoprotective functions.

There is great potential in interfacing non- natural materials with living cells and in the biomedical and nanobiomedical fields. It can be a nanoarchitectonics method for engineering next-generation cellular hybrid systems. Covering the perimeter of a living cell with an artificial sub\u00ad stance also provides a model for the extracellular matrix. This can be useful for clinical research. For example, high extracellu\u00ad lar matrix stiffness is a prominent feature of malignant tumors. To elucidate the mechanistic link between increased matrix stiff\u00ad ness and tumor progression, it is necessary to develop an external chamber in which stiffness can be controlled. The matrix can be wirelessly and reversibly stiffened and softened multiple times and at different rates of change using an external magnet as re\u00ad ported by Tay and coworkers (Fig. 26).84 This structure was used to study the effects of dynamic matrix stiffness changes on 3D cancer spheroids. An external static magnetic field was used to dynamically change the mechanical stiffness of the hydrogel to mimic healthy and malignant breast tissue. They Fig. 22.

Such nanoarchitectonics systems provide a better understanding of the impact of matrix softening on cancer biology. It can be a powerful tool in applications such as drug screening in clinical trials. Attempts are also being made to construct tissue-like struc\u00ad tures in which cells are assembled. Such attempts are also at\u00ad tracting attention from other perspectives. The development of tissue-like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and or\u00ad ganoids has contributed to the progress of regenerative medi\u00ad cine.85 However, these artificial cellular tissue structures cannot provide sufficient oxygen to the interior of large tissues with high cell density.

In addition to atoms, molecules, supramolecules, nanoma\u00ad terials, and biomolecules, the cell itself is a component of nanoarchitectonics. Hybridizing and organizing cells with artificial structures can create cellular systems that confer functions not available in the original cell. Such nanoarchitec\u00ad tonics can also create an artificial environment for studying cellular functions. In addition, nanoarchitectonics, such as cell organization, can contribute to fields such as regenerative medicine. 9.
